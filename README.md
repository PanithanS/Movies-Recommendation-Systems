# Recommendation Systems for the IMDb movies
## Introduction
Recommendation systems are a specialized area of machine learning that focuses on the evaluation and management of users or items. These techniques are frequently used by big companies like Google, Instagram, Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix to increase user engagement and platform usage. For instance, Spotify uses recommendation algorithms to provide music that is similar to tracks that a user has previously liked or enjoyed in order to keep them using their music streaming service. Amazon, meanwhile, leverages recommendation algorithms to provide product recommendations to specific consumers based on the extensive user data they have collected.

# Contents
Here, we mock-up the movie recommendation system with data collected from IMDb. We build a machine learning-driven method for filtering and predicting the movie preferences of the user by analyzing their personal tastes and community ratings. This recommendation system facilitates movie selections for the user and guides them toward a specific domain of movies.

Cast, crew, narrative keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, language, production firms, nations, vote totals, and vote averages are just a few examples of the data points.
